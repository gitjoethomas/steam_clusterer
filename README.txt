The objective of this project is to cluster Steam gamers together, in order to recommend them games based off what they and their friends have played in the past. The steps are as follows:

1) Find active Steam IDs by querying Steam's API - IN PROGRESS
2) KMeans clustering to understand groups better. - IN PROGRESS. INITIAL SILHOUETTE SCORE - 0.55 - GOOD START, COULD BE BETTER.
3) Profiling and automated recommender system. - NOT YET BEGUN

Work in progress
